        <h1> What is hardware?</h1>
        <p> Hardware can be compared to the body of a computer or electronic device, encompassing a multitude of tangible components that are observable and touchable. These components, ranging from the CPU and memory to storage devices and input/output peripherals, collaborate harmoniously to carry out diverse tasks and facilitate seamless interaction between users and their devices. A prime example is the CPU, which assumes the role of the computer's brain, meticulously executing instructions and computations, while the memory diligently stores data temporarily, ensuring swift accessibility when required. In essence, hardware serves as the fundamental infrastructure that empowers the operation and functionality of software, empowering individuals to engage in activities like web browsing, gaming, and content creation.

                <h1> Processor </h1>
                <p>A processor, also known as a central processing unit (CPU), is the core component of a computer that acts as its brain. It carries out calculations, executes instructions, and manages the overall functioning of the computer system. The processor consists of various components, including the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs mathematical and logical operations, and the control unit, which coordinates the flow of data and instructions. It also has registers, small storage areas that temporarily hold data during processing. The processor retrieves instructions and data from the computer's memory, interprets them, and performs the required operations. The speed of a processor is measured in gigahertz (GHz), indicating how many billions of cycles it can execute per second.</p>

                <h1> Ram </h1>
                <p> 
                    RAM stands for Random Access Memory and is a crucial component in a computer system. It is a type of volatile memory that provides temporary storage for data that the computer needs to access quickly. RAM allows the processor to read and write data rapidly, providing fast and efficient access to information. Unlike long-term storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives, RAM is much faster but loses its stored data when the computer is powered off. RAM modules are physical sticks that are inserted into the motherboard of a computer and come in varying capacities. The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can hold and access simultaneously, which improves overall system performance and multitasking capabilities.</p>

                <h1>Storage Devices</h1>
                <p>Storage devices are essential components in a computer system that store and preserve data for long-term use. They provide the ability to save files, programs, and other digital content. There are various types of storage devices, including hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). HDDs use magnetic disks to store data, offering large storage capacities at affordable prices but with slower read and write speeds. SSDs, on the other hand, use flash memory to store data, providing faster access times, higher speeds, and enhanced durability. Additionally, external storage devices such as USB flash drives, memory cards, and external hard drives allow for portable and expandable storage options. These storage devices play a crucial role in preserving data and enabling users to store and access their files and information reliably.

                <h1> Keyboard & Mouse</h1>
                <p>A keyboard and mouse are two common input devices used to interact with a computer. The keyboard consists of a set of keys that allow users to input text, commands, and control various functions. It enables typing, navigating through applications, and executing shortcuts. On the other hand, a mouse is a handheld device that translates hand movements into cursor movements on the computer screen. It typically has buttons for performing actions such as clicking, right-clicking, and scrolling. The mouse enables precise pointing, clicking on objects, and navigating graphical user interfaces. Together, the keyboard and mouse provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with and controlling a computer system, facilitating tasks such as writing, browsing, gaming, and operating software applications.</p>
